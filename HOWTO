This is a guide on possibilities provided by the PathFinder module, and how to use them.

I strongly advice you read the LoadMe_Test.lua. As it is the simplest application of the module you can make.
The Settings are located in Pathfinder/Settings/static_Settings.lua, You should read and modify them if you want.
How to enable Dig / Headbutt / Discoving Items ? Read the setting file.

The only module you need to require is MoveToApp. The module return a table of functions.
Pathfinder = require "Pathfinder/MoveToApp"
